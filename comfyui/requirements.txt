# ComfyUI Custom Nodes Requirements
# These are in addition to the main sync-toolkit requirements

# ComfyUI base (usually installed with ComfyUI)
# No explicit dependency needed - nodes will work when installed in ComfyUI

# Additional dependencies that may be needed:
# - boto3 (for S3 operations) - should already be in sync-toolkit requirements
# - requests (for API calls) - should already be in sync-toolkit requirements
# - scenedetect (for scene detection) - optional, will work without it

# Note: Install main sync-toolkit requirements first:
# pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
